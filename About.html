<h1>SRILANKA</h1>
	<br>
	<p>Sri Lanka’s culture is a vibrant blend of ancient traditions, spiritual practices, and diverse influences that reflect its rich history. Known for its deep-rooted heritage in Buddhism, Sri Lanka's culture features prominently in its temple architecture, annual festivals, and rituals like the Kandy Esala Perahera—a grand procession celebrating the Sacred Tooth Relic of Buddha. Traditional arts such as Kandyan dance, drumming, and masked dances bring an expressive storytelling style to life. Sri Lanka is also famous for its elaborate craftsmanship in weaving, wood carving, and batik design.<br><br>

Hospitality is a cornerstone of Sri Lankan culture, with warm welcomes and shared meals reflecting the island’s communal values. Food is central to its identity, with curries, sambols, and spicy dishes crafted from local ingredients, often enjoyed with rice or roti. The tea culture, rooted in colonial heritage, remains essential, with tea plantations across the central highlands offering stunning landscapes and world-renowned Ceylon tea.<br><br>

With influences from Tamil, Sinhalese, Moor, and Burgher communities, Sri Lankan culture is rich and layered, shaped by centuries of trade, colonialism, and its strategic location on the Silk Road. Cultural practices and festivals like Tamil Thai Pongal and Sinhala and Tamil New Year highlight the harmonious coexistence of various ethnicities, religions, and languages, making Sri Lankan culture a unique tapestry that captivates locals and visitors alike.</p>
